Description: Provides functions for the computationally efficient simulation and resimulation of 
             dynamic networks estimated with the statistical framework of temporal exponential 
             random graph models (TERGMs), implemented in the tergm package within the Statnet 
             suite of R software. Networks are represented within an edgelist format only, with 
             nodal attributes stored separately. Also includes efficient functions for the deletion 
             and addition of nodes within that nework representation.
